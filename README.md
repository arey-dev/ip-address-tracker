## My process

### Built with
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use Tailwind CSS. At first it was confusing because it's my first time utilizing it in a project. But as I go on with the project, I gradually appreciate the beauty of this CSS framework. 

Not only did I experience using tailwind css, but also the use of leaflet-js. It's a tool to create interactive maps to integrate with your app.

### Continued development

In my next projects, I want to focus on react-router and some advance concepts of react, like Redux and PropTypes. In addition to that, I also want to work on file structire of my react app.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - You can learn Tailwind CSS here.
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - Useful when using React.
